/*
The Repository Layer (CityRepository) ->

The logic here is Database Centric.

Responsibility: Its only job is to talk to the database (via Sequelize).

Logic: It deals with database models, SQL queries, and raw data persistence.

Knowledge: It knows how to save a city to a table called Cities. It doesn't care why the city is being created or who is asking.
